# Implementation-of-Radix-4-Multiplier-using-Cadence-Virtuoso-
A Radix Multiplier is a digital circuit that performs binary multiplication using an  optimized algorithm to reduce computation steps. Unlike basic multipliers that  process bits one-by-one (Radix-2), higher Radix multipliers (e.g., Radix-4, Radix-8)  group bits to process multiple bits simultaneously, improving speed and efficiency.
